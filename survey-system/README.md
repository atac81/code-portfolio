# Online Survey System
Samples of code from an online survey system originally designed in 2009 that has had continued development ever since based on the growing needs of the client.

Originally conceived as a site for entering a random PIN number to anonymously record feedback using a custom survey, the system has grown to allow for access to a menu of surveys using a student's school ID number, for survey reminders to be sent out via e-mail, and for automatic login to a student's survey menu using a designated URL.

The live system can be viewed at http://sample.css-evaluation.com/

<b>Please Note:</b> this live system is a demo for their prospective customers.  No actual data is recorded when submitting the survey.
